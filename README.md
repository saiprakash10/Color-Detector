# Intruder-Alarm

This hardware based interface detects motion from its sensors and alerts us immediately. The alert can be in the form of 3 different outputs for all kinds of situations, namely, flashing of LED, alarm in a Buzzer and an Alert Message(SMS). Once we detect an intrusion, the alert is sent and then the user can safeguard their property.
